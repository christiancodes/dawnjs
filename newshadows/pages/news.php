    So I'll be at TCAF on the weekend if anyone else is in town! You can visit me and my musician Clark Powell on the third floor with Comics vs Games!
  </p>
  <p>
    When I come back we'll be changing things for TWS a little bit. I took a survey on twitter some time ago asking people if they prefer when I post full chapters or if I should go page-by-page and the results were unanimously for the latter. While the animation thing I'm working on for Chapter 4 is taking some time, the first half of the chapter is almost ready to be posted, so! In the future I will post TWS when it is ready, instead of in big chunks all at once. Please look forward to an update next week! I'll build a buffer while we work on programming the animation.

    Meanwhile, you can now read and play Those Without Shadows on your mobile device! Please give it a try! Thank you!
